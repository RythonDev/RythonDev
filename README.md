# Hello there, this is RythonDev's alternate Github Account! 

You're probably looking for my main Github account [liyunze-coding](https://github.com/liyunze-coding)

---

### Why don't you just rename your main Github account to liyunze-coding?

My task widget got popular, and in the `!taskhelp` command, it links to the repository with `liyunze-coding` in the name. As a result, I decided not to rename my Github username and only update the display name. 

### Why don't you change your alt account's username to `liyunze-coding` and change your main account's username to `RythonDev` and move some projects there?

1. Too much effort and risk
2. I have Github Pro and many projects on my main account

### What's the origin of the username liyunze-coding?

liyunze ( /ˈliː.juːn.zə/  ) is actually my Chinese name (without the Chinese tones) but because people tend to have difficulty reading it, I don't use it besides my Github and Codepen.

### Did anyone actually ask these questions?

No, I made them up, but I heavily anticipate these questions will come up.
